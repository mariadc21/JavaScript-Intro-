// Very Easy

var num1= 6;
var num2= 2;
var num3= num1 - num2;
console.log(` The difference between ${num1} and ${num2} is ${num3}`)

// Easy 
var person1="Thomas";
var person2= "John";

if(person1.length > person2.length){
    console.log(`the name ${person1} is longer than ${person2} by ${person1.length - person2.length} characters `)
} else if (person2.length > person1.length){
    console.log(`the name ${person2} is longer than ${person1} by ${person2.length - person1.length} characters `)
}
// MEDIUM: Write a program to tell if someone is shouting (typing in all caps),
//  whispering (typing in all lowercase), or neither. 
//  Use prompt to get user input, and then console log whether the user
//   was shouting, whispering, or talking normally.
// HARD: Create 4 math functions, one called add() that adds 2 numbers, one called subtract() that subtracts 2 numbers, one called multiply() to multiply 2 numbers, and one called divide() to divide two numbers.
